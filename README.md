### Hi there 👋

My name is Stanley Lee,

I'm a full-stack software engineer from New York, NY. I attended and graduated Flatiron School, an 15 week immersive coding bootcamp located in New York. Since graduating, I've been busy building exciting new side projects where I can learn new things and further implement skills I already have. I'm currently sharpening my skills as a Software Engineer and would love to collaborate with anyone looking to work together. Hit me up if you have any questions!
